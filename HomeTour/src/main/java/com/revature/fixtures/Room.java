 * 		- Room[] exits: the rooms adjacent to this one. You might decide that a room in a 
 * 						particular direction always uses a certain index, e.g. a north exit
 * 						always goes in index 0, an east exit always goes in index 1, etc. 
 * 						If so, then the size of this array depends on how many directions you
 * 						you want to support. 
 * 
 * 		- Constructor that accepts a name, shortDescription, and longDescription.
 * 		- create a getter not just for all the exits, but for a particular exit given a direction.
